        <h2>HOW Does Internet Work?</h2>
        <h3>Principle 1: The Need to Share Information</h3>
        <p>The most fundamental truth is that we have information on one computer (Computer A) and we want it to be on another computer (Computer B). These computers are not in the same room.</p>
        <p>How do we solve this? The simplest, most primitive way is to physically carry the information (e.g., on a USB stick). This works, but it's slow and doesn't scale. We need a direct, electronic connection.</p>
        <p>So, we run a cable (like an ethernet cable or a fiber optic line) between Computer A and Computer B. We can now send electrical signals or pulses of light down this cable. We can agree on a simple code: a high-voltage signal means "1," and a low-voltage signal means "0."</p>
        <p>We have just created the most basic form of a network: a direct link. We can now send bits (1s and 0s) between two computers.</p>
        <h3>Principle 2: The Problem of Scale</h3>
        <p>This works for two computers. But what if we have three computers (A, B, and C) and they all need to talk to each other? We would need a cable from A to B, from B to C, and from A to C. For four computers, we'd need six cables. For 100 computers, we'd need 4,950 cables.</p>
