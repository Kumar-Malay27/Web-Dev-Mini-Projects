        <h2>Step 1: The First Principle (The Fundamental Truth)</h2>
        <p>The most fundamental truth is this: A website is not one single file.</p>
        <p>It's a collection of different files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, videos, fonts) that all need to work together. These files are organized into folders, just like documents on your computer.</p>

        <h2>Step 2: The Core Problem</h2>
        <p>Now we have a core problem: If your index.html file needs to display an image named logo.png, how does the HTML file tell the browser where to find logo.png?</p>
        <p>You can't just say src="logo.png" and expect it to work every time. What if the logo is in an images folder? What if it's on a completely different website?</p>
        <p>The browser needs an exact, unambiguous address to locate the file. A file path is that address.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>A) Relative File Paths (The Most Important for Your Projects)</h2>
        <p>A relative file path gives directions to a file starting from the location of the file you are currently in. You will use this 99% of the time for linking your own files together (images, CSS, other HTML pages).</p>
        <img src="a.jpg" alt="image">
        <p>Here are the different scenarios:</p>
        <h3>Scenario 1: Linking to a file in the SAME folder.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The Problem: You are in index.html and want to link to about.html.</li>
            <li>The Logic: They are neighbors, living in the same my-website/ folder. The directions are as simple as possible.</li>
            <li>The Syntax: You just use the filename.</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="b.jpg" alt="image">
        <h3>Scenario 2: Linking to a file in a SUB-FOLDER (Going Down).</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The Problem: You are in index.html and want to display logo.png.</li>
            <li>The Logic: From index.html, you need to go into the images folder to find the logo.</li>
            <li>The Syntax: You write the folder name, a forward slash /, and then the filename.codeHtml</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="c.jpg" alt="image">
        <h3>Scenario 3: Linking to a file in a PARENT FOLDER (Going Up).</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The Problem: You are in contact.html (which is inside pages/) and you want to display logo.png (which is inside images/).</li>
            <li>The Logic: You can't go directly from pages/ to images/. You must first go up one level out of the pages folder to get back to the main my-website/ folder. From there, you can go down into the images folder.</li>
            <li>The Syntax: Two dots and a slash (../) means "go up one level."codeHtml
                <ul>
                    <li>../ takes you from pages/ up to my-website/.</li>
                    <li>images/logo.png then takes you down into the images folder to find the file.</li>
                    <img src="d.jpg" alt="image">
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>B) Absolute File Paths</h2>
        <p>An absolute file path gives the full, complete URL to a resource on the web. It starts with http:// or https://.</p>
        <h3>When to use it:</h3>
        <p>You ONLY use absolute paths when you are linking to a resource that is NOT on your own website.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Linking to another website.</li>
            <li>Using a font from Google Fonts.</li>
            <li>Using an image from an image-hosting service.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>codeHtml</p>
        <img src="e.jpg" alt="image">
        <h3>The Critical "Why": Why not use absolute paths for your own files?</h3>
        <p>A beginner might be tempted to copy the full path from their computer, like this:</p>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(253, 0, 0);">src="C:/Users/Arjun/Desktop/my-website/images/logo.png"</span></p>
        <p>This is a major mistake. This address only works on your computer. The moment you upload your website to a real web server, that path becomes meaningless and the image will be broken.</p>
        <p>Think of a web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, etc.) as a secure prison for the code it runs. This prison is called a "sandbox."</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Inmates: The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code you load.</li>
            <li>The Prison Walls: The browser itself.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The primary rule of this prison is: Code running inside the sandbox is NOT allowed to freely access the host computer's file system.</p>
        <h3>The Core Problem: A Malicious Website</h3>
        <p>Imagine if this security rule didn't exist. You could visit a malicious website, evil-website.com, and it could contain the following HTML:</p>
        <p>codeHtml</p>
        <img src="f.jpg" alt="image">
        <p>If the browser allowed this, the website could potentially read the contents of your private files, your photos, your documents—anything on your computer. It would be a catastrophic security disaster.</p>
        <p>Relative paths, however, will always work because they describe the location of files relative to each other, no matter what computer or server they are on.</p>
        <h3>Summary / Rules of Thumb</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>For Your Own Files (Internal Links): ALWAYS use Relative Paths.
                <ul>
                    <li>filename.html (Same folder)</li>
                    <li>folder/filename.html (Go down)</li>
                    <li>../filename.html (Go up)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>For Other Websites' Files (External Links): ALWAYS use Absolute Paths.
                <ul>
                    <li>https://www.example.com/page.html</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3><span style="color: rgb(142, 107, 199);">Absolute Path in Windows</span></h3>
        <p>The Windows file system is organized into separate drives, each identified by a letter (like C:, D:, etc.).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Starting Point (The Root): An absolute path in Windows always starts with a drive letter followed by a colon and a backslash, like C:\. This is the "root" of that specific drive.</li>
            <li>Directory Separator: Windows uses a backslash \ to separate directories and files in the path.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Windows Structure:</h4>
        <p>Drive:\Folder\SubFolder\file.txt</p>
        <h4>Example:</h4>
        <p>Imagine a file named report.docx located in the Documents folder of a user named JohnDoe on the main C: drive.</p>
        <h5>The absolute path would be:</h5>
        <p>C:\Users\JohnDoe\Documents\report.docx</p>
        <h5>Let's break it down:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>C:\ - Start at the root of the C drive.</li>
            <li>Users - Go into the "Users" folder.</li>
            <li>JohnDoe - Go into the "JohnDoe" folder.</li>
            <li>Documents - Go into the "Documents" folder.</li>
            <li>report.docx - Here is the file.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h3><span style="color: rgb(142, 107, 199);">Absolute Path in macOS (and Linux)</span></h3>
        <p>The macOS file system (like Linux and other Unix-like systems) does not use drive letters. Instead, it has a single, unified file system.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Starting Point (The Root): An absolute path in macOS always starts with a single forward slash /. This symbol represents the one and only root of the entire file system.</li>
            <li>Directory Separator: macOS uses a forward slash / to separate directories and files. (This is the same separator used in web URLs, which is a helpful thing to remember).</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>macOS Structure:</h4>
        <p>/Folder/SubFolder/file.txt</p>
        <h4>Example:</h4>
        <p>Let's find the same file: report.docx in the Documents folder for the user johndoe.</p>
        <p>The absolute path would be:</p>
        <p>/Users/johndoe/Documents/report.docx</p>
        <h5>Let's break it down:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>/ - Start at the absolute root of the entire file system.</li>
            <li>Users - Go into the "Users" directory.</li>
            <li>johndoe - Go into the "johndoe" directory (usernames are typically lowercase on macOS/Linux).</li>
            <li>Documents - Go into the "Documents" directory.</li>
            <li>report.docx - Here is the file.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><span style="color: darkblue;">HTML Boilerplate Code</span></h2>
        <h3>Step 1: The First Principle (The Fundamental Truth)</h3>
        <p>The fundamental truth is that a web browser is a program that needs specific, predictable instructions to do its job. It cannot guess your intentions. You can't just give it a file with a &lt;h1&gt; tag and expect it to know what kind of document it is, what language it's in, or how to render it properly.</p>
        <h3>Step 2: The Core Problem</h3>
        <p>We need a way to give the browser essential "setup information" before it starts rendering our visible content (like paragraphs and images). This setup information needs to answer critical questions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"What version of HTML am I reading?" (So I know which rules to follow).</li>
            <li>"What character encoding should I use?" (So characters like ©, ’, or ₹ are displayed correctly and not as gibberish like â€™).</li>
            <li>"What should the title of the browser tab be?"</li>
            <li>"How should this page behave on a mobile device vs. a desktop?"</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Just writing &lt;p&gt; Hello &lt;p&gt; doesn't answer any of these questions.</p>
        <h3>Step 3: The Logical Solution - The Boilerplate</h3>
        <p>The solution is to create a standard, universal starting template—a boilerplate. This is a block of code that you will start every single HTML file with. It's not something you need to reinvent each time; you just copy-paste it and fill in the blanks.</p>
        <p>It's the "blueprint of the house" that you need before you can start putting in the walls (&lt;h1&gt;) and windows (&lt;img&gt;).</p>
        <p>Let's build the modern HTML5 boilerplate from first principles:</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>The Anatomy of the HTML Boilerplate</h3>
        <p>codeHtml</p>
        <img src="g.jpg" alt="image">
        <p>Let's break down each line and explain why it's necessary.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
                <ul>
                    <li>The Problem: In the past, there were many versions of HTML (HTML4, XHTML, etc.). The browser needed to know which set of rules to use to render the page.</li>
                    <li>The Solution: This is the very first line and it's called the Document Type Declaration. In modern HTML5, it's incredibly simple. This specific line tells the browser: "Use the latest, standard-compliant mode for rendering this HTML document." It's a switch that prevents the browser from falling back into "quirks mode" (an old mode for rendering non-standard pages). It must always be the first thing in your file.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>&lt;html lang="en"&gt;...&lt;/html&gt;
                <ul>
                    <li>The Problem: The web is global. How do search engines (like Google) and screen readers (for accessibility) know what human language the content is written in?</li>
                    <li>The Solution: This is the root element that wraps your entire page. The lang="en" attribute declares that the primary language of the page content is English. This is very important for accessibility and SEO. You'd change "en" to "es" for Spanish, "hi" for Hindi, etc.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>&lt;head&gt;...&lt;/head&gt;
                <ul>
                    <li>The Problem: As discussed, we need a place to put all the "behind-the-scenes" information that is for the browser, not for the user to see on the page.</li>
                    <li>The Solution: The &lt;head&gt; section is the container for this metadata. Nothing you put inside the &lt;head&gt; will be displayed in the main browser window.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
                <ul>
                    <li>The Problem: Computers fundamentally only understand numbers. To display text, they use a "character set" to map numbers to letters. There are many different character sets, and if the browser uses the wrong one, your text will be garbled.</li>
                    <li>The Solution: This meta tag explicitly tells the browser to use UTF-8, which is the universal standard character set for the web. It can represent almost any character and symbol from any language in the world. This line is essential to prevent text-encoding issues.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>&lt;meta name="viewport"...&gt;</li>
