        <h2>### Step 1: The First Principle (The Fundamental Truth)</h2>
        <p>The most fundamental truth is this: A website is not one single file.</p>
        <p>It's a collection of different files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, videos, fonts) that all need to work together. These files are organized into folders, just like documents on your computer.</p>

        <h2>Step 2: The Core Problem</h2>
        <p>Now we have a core problem: If your index.html file needs to display an image named logo.png, how does the HTML file tell the browser where to find logo.png?</p>
        <p>You can't just say src="logo.png" and expect it to work every time. What if the logo is in an images folder? What if it's on a completely different website?</p>
        <p>The browser needs an exact, unambiguous address to locate the file. A file path is that address.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>A) Relative File Paths (The Most Important for Your Projects)</h2>
        <p>A relative file path gives directions to a file starting from the location of the file you are currently in. You will use this 99% of the time for linking your own files together (images, CSS, other HTML pages).</p>
