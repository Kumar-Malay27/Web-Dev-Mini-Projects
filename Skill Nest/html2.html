        <h2>Step 1: The First Principle (The Fundamental Truth)</h2>
        <p>The most fundamental truth is this: A website is not one single file.</p>
        <p>It's a collection of different files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, videos, fonts) that all need to work together. These files are organized into folders, just like documents on your computer.</p>

        <h2>Step 2: The Core Problem</h2>
        <p>Now we have a core problem: If your index.html file needs to display an image named logo.png, how does the HTML file tell the browser where to find logo.png?</p>
        <p>You can't just say src="logo.png" and expect it to work every time. What if the logo is in an images folder? What if it's on a completely different website?</p>
        <p>The browser needs an exact, unambiguous address to locate the file. A file path is that address.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>A) Relative File Paths (The Most Important for Your Projects)</h2>
        <p>A relative file path gives directions to a file starting from the location of the file you are currently in. You will use this 99% of the time for linking your own files together (images, CSS, other HTML pages).</p>

        <p>Here are the different scenarios:</p>
        <h3>Scenario 1: Linking to a file in the SAME folder.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The Problem: You are in index.html and want to link to about.html.</li>
            <li>The Logic: They are neighbors, living in the same my-website/ folder. The directions are as simple as possible.</li>
            <li>The Syntax: You just use the filename.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Scenario 2: Linking to a file in a SUB-FOLDER (Going Down).</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The Problem: You are in index.html and want to display logo.png.</li>
            <li>The Logic: From index.html, you need to go into the images folder to find the logo.</li>
            <li>The Syntax: You write the folder name, a forward slash /, and then the filename.codeHtml</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="c.jpg" alt="image">
        <h3>Scenario 3: Linking to a file in a PARENT FOLDER (Going Up).</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The Problem: You are in contact.html (which is inside pages/) and you want to display logo.png (which is inside images/).</li>
            <li>The Logic: You can't go directly from pages/ to images/. You must first go up one level out of the pages folder to get back to the main my-website/ folder. From there, you can go down into the images folder.</li>
            <li>The Syntax: Two dots and a slash (../) means "go up one level."codeHtml
                <ul>
                    <li>../ takes you from pages/ up to my-website/.</li>
                    <li>images/logo.png then takes you down into the images folder to find the file.</li>
                    <img src="d.jpg" alt="image">
                </ul>
            </li>
